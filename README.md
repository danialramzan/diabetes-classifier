# Diabetes Prediction through Logistic Regression Model

This repository contains the code, analysis, and detailed write-up for our third-year data science project at the University of British Columbia (UBC) as part of my STAT301 class. The goal of this project was to develop and evaluate a logistic regression model to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. This project was particularly focused on understanding and documenting the challenges, improvements, and potential issues associated with the model.

## Dataset and License

The dataset used for this project, known as the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, is publicly available and is widely used in diabetes research. It is distributed under the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license and can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).

## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project was to employ logistic regression to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on several medical predictor variables. The dataset includes various features, such as glucose levels and body mass index, which are instrumental in understanding the risk factors for diabetes. To fully understand the problem domain, we reviewed past work done on the subject, as well as background information on the dataset that we were performing the regression on.

### Key Contributions:

- **Introduction & Background**: Provided a comprehensive introduction to the problem of diabetes prediction, highlighting the significance of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset.
- **Sources & Literature Review**: Conducted a detailed review of relevant literature and sources, ensuring that our approach was informed by existing research and best practices.
- **Identifying Issues**: Analyzed the challenges faced during model development, including data imbalances and the limitations of logistic regression in certain scenarios.
- **Improvements & Recommendations**: Proposed potential improvements to the model, such as the exploration of alternative algorithms and techniques for handling imbalanced datasets.
- **Proofreading**: Contributed to ensuring the clarity and cohesiveness of the project report through meticulous proofreading.

## Approach

The team collaborated closely, with a division of tasks that allowed each member to leverage their strengths. I had previously focused on the coding as part of a previous kNN classifier I made as part of a previous data science course, and so took on a different role this time, concentrating on writing, documentation, and critical analysis of the model. This shift in focus allowed for a richer, more nuanced understanding of the writeup process and its application to the dataset.

The logistic regression model was developed using R within a Jupyter Notebook environment. Key steps included data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Despite some challenges, such as the imbalance in the dataset, the model achieved a reasonable accuracy, and several areas for further improvement were identified.

## Conclusion

This project provided an invaluable opportunity to apply data science techniques while also focusing on the critical aspects of communication, analysis, and reporting. By shifting focus from coding to writing and analysis, I gained deeper insights into the broader context of data science projects. The project successfully highlighted both the potential and the limitations of logistic regression in predicting diabetes and paved the way for future explorations into more advanced models.
